# 🖼️ Image Classification with RNN

This project demonstrates a simple **image classification pipeline** using a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**. It takes a set of random images, processes them into sequences, and predicts their class labels.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Load and preprocess images of various formats  
- ✅ Convert images into sequences suitable for RNN input  
- ✅ Train and evaluate an **RNN model** for classification  
- ✅ Predict labels for new, unseen images  
- ✅ Supports configurable model architecture and hyperparameters
