# 🖼️ Image Classification with CNN

This project demonstrates a simple **image classification pipeline** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. It takes a set of random images, processes them, and predicts their class labels.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Load and preprocess images of various formats  
- ✅ Use a **CNN model** for feature extraction and classification  
- ✅ Train and evaluate the model on a small dataset  
- ✅ Predict labels for new, unseen images  
- ✅ Configurable model architecture and hyperparameters
